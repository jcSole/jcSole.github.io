  abstract   = {We propose an estimation method for the Generalized Stochastic Preference choice model, which subsumes the family of Random Utility Maximization models and is capable of capturing halo effects. We show how to use partially-ranked preferences to efficiently model rational and irrational customer types from transaction data. Our approach employs column generation with a novel dominance rule to extract customer types. Testing on grocery and drug store data shows that accounting for irrational preferences can boost predictive accuracy by 12.5% on average.}

  abstract   = {We study optimizing assortment decisions in the presence of product-specific costs when customers choose according to a multinomial logit model. We propose the first exact solution method for this NP-hard problem, finding provably optimal assortments for instances with up to 1,000 products in about 0.2 seconds. Our approach extends to handle cardinality constraints and mixed-multinomial logit models.}
