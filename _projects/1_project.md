This project focuses on developing and estimating discrete choice models that capture complex customer behaviors in retail settings. The key contributions include:

- **Generalized Stochastic Preference (GSP) models** that go beyond the classical Random Utility Maximization framework to capture irrational behaviors such as halo effects
- **Partially-ranked preference models** that efficiently learn customer types from transaction data using column generation
- **Scalable estimation procedures** capable of handling thousands of products in real-world retail datasets

This work resulted in publications in the *INFORMS Journal on Computing* and the *INFORMS Journal on Optimization*.
