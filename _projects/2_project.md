This project investigates how demand forecasting models can be embedded into optimization routines to solve the assortment optimization problem — selecting the best set of products to offer customers in order to maximize revenue.

Key contributions include:

- **Exact solution methods** for assortment optimization problems with product-specific costs under the multinomial logit choice model
- **Scalable algorithms** that find provably optimal assortments for instances with up to 1,000 products in fractions of a second
- Extensions to handle **cardinality constraints** and **mixed-multinomial logit models**

This work was published in the *INFORMS Journal on Computing*.
