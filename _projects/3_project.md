In my industry work as a Founding Data Scientist, I apply tools from both Operations Research and Machine Learning to achieve data-driven decisions that are robust, explainable, and data-efficient.

Key areas of focus include:

- **Low-rank models** and **Bayesian learning** for dealing with data sparsity in real-world settings
- **Causal inference** to move beyond correlation-based insights toward actionable decision support
- **Explainable models** that practitioners can adopt and justify to stakeholders
- Communication of scientific results to non-technical audiences
