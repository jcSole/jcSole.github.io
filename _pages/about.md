I am a Founding Data Scientist with a PhD, working at the intersection of Operations Research and Machine Learning to achieve data-driven decisions that are robust, explainable, and data-efficient.

During my PhD at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/), I focused on developing **discrete choice models** to forecast the demand of products, taking into account substitution (cannibalization) effects and complementarity ones. I also investigated how these demand forecasting models can be embedded into **optimization routines** to identify the optimal set of products to maximize revenue for a retailer.

In my day-to-day work, I deal with data-sparsity challenges, which has pushed me into topics such as **low-rank models**, **Bayesian learning**, and **causal inference**. I also appreciate the value of simple, explainable models that are easier to adopt by practitioners, especially when decisions need to be justified to stakeholders. Communication of scientific results to non-technical audiences is a key aspect of my work.
